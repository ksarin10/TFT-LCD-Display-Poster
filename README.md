# TFT LCD Display Poster
 This repository deals with displaying AI generated images that I created on a TFT LCD from a directory/SD card using an Arduino, thereby creating a "digital" poster. The file wallpaper.py was used as a test to display the images randomly when the user said a keyword. CardInfo.ino is arduino code that connects to the TFT LCD to display the images on a time interval.
